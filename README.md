Catalog of Products 

Overview

This project is a "Catalog of Products" website aimed at showcasing various items with detailed images and descriptions, inspired by the idea of creating an organized and visually appealing catalog. The project focuses on building a responsive, user-friendly interface using Bootstrap to simplify layout management and ensure a consistent design.

The website includes multiple product pages and an author information page, demonstrating the effective use of web development techniques including HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The project serves as a great foundation for anyone interested in building product portfolios, e-commerce prototypes, or catalog-based websites.

The website will consist of the following pages:
